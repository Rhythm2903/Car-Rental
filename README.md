## Introduction
This Car Rental System is a console-based project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The system allows users to rent cars, manage rentals, and view available cars. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the application of OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
